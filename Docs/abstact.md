## Authors

## Location
Mozambique, 2024

## Objective
To investigate how different colored lighting (red, green, blue) affects human accuracy in distance estimation tasks.

## Hypothesis
H₀: Color does not affect distance perception accuracy.  
H₁: Different colors significantly affect distance perception.

## Methodology
- Controlled laboratory experiment
- 3 participants (within-subjects design)
- Arduino-based measurement system
- Randomized color sequence
- 9 tests total (3 colors × 3 repetitions)
- Python statistical analysis pipeline

## Key Findings
1. Significant color effect (ANOVA: p = 0.018)
2. Red: Highest accuracy (mean error: 2.1cm)
3. Blue: Systematic overestimation (+3.8cm)
4. Green: Intermediate performance
5. Medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.65)

## Conclusion
Light color significantly influences distance perception, with practical implications for aviation display design and human-machine interfaces in Mozambique and globally.
