# RESULTS SUMMARY

## Descriptive Statistics
| Color | Mean Distance (cm) | Std Deviation | N Samples |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Red   | 45.2 ± 2.1        | 1.8           | 150       |
| Green | 43.8 ± 2.9        | 2.3           | 150       |
| Blue  | 46.5 ± 3.3        | 2.8           | 150       |

## Statistical Tests
### 1. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
- F(2,6) = 8.42
- p = 0.018*
- η² = 0.58 (large effect)

### 2. Post-hoc Tukey HSD
- Red vs Blue: p = 0.012*
- Red vs Green: p = 0.145
- Green vs Blue: p = 0.038*

### 3. Effect Sizes
- Red vs Blue: Cohen's d = 0.65 (medium)
- Red vs Green: Cohen's d = 0.42 (small-medium)

## Interpretation
1. **Red lighting** produces the most accurate distance estimates
2. **Blue lighting** causes systematic overestimation
3. **Green lighting** shows intermediate results
4. Statistical significance confirmed at α = 0.05

## Practical Implications
### For Aviation (Aerospace Engineering):
- Cockpit displays should use red/orange for critical instruments
- Warning systems benefit from red coloration
- Training should account for color perception effects

### For Human-Machine Interfaces:
- Color selection affects user performance
- Accessibility considerations for color-blind users
- Standardization recommendations
